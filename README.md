# 🧠 JavaScript Practice & Problem Solving

Welcome to my **JavaScript Practice Repository** — a personal space dedicated to sharpening my **logic-building**, **problem-solving**, and **JavaScript fundamentals**, with the long-term goal of transitioning into **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** using JavaScript.

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice JavaScript consistently, starting with daily challenges  
- Strengthen logical thinking and core programming concepts  
- Build a solid foundation before diving into DSA topics

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repo is organized for easy navigation and future scalability:

- `day1.js`, `day2.js`, etc. — Daily coding challenges and solutions  
- Topic-wise folders (`basic/`, `arrays/`, etc.) may be added as I progress  
- Each file includes clear solutions and explanations for learning and review

> *Note:* As the journey continues, this structure will evolve to support advanced concepts and DSA topics.
